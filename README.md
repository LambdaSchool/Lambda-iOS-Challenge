# Lambda iOS Challenge

If you have not yet filled out the form at https://apply.lambdaschool.com/ please do that before starting the precourse work explained here.

In order to remove even more barriers for those that want to participate in Lambda School, we've created the Lambda iOS precourse work curriculum. Based on our data, we are confident that if you can complete the precourse work, we can help you learn to code, and get a job as an iOS developer.

You can find the iOS precourse work [here](https://apply.lambdaschool.com/courses/ios-precourse/).

## Curriculum

The iOS precourse curriculum teaches the following concepts and skills:

```
Swift
  constants and variables
  types such as String, Int, Bool, etc.
  conditionals
  optionals
  loops
  functions
  collections
```

## The Challenge

As part of the precourse work, in order to start at Lambda, you **must** complete a series of three challenges. 

Join the first challenge [here](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/7wv4ob2). If you have never used repl.it before, you will need to sign up for a free account.

You will then see a list of assignments. Please complete them in order (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, etc.). Repl.it works like an online Swift Playground. You are able to write and run code there directly. It will also test your code to make sure it works. The tests can be somewhat finnicky, so the instructions may tell you to do something like print a variable or function in order for the tests to test your code correctly. **Please be sure to read all of the instructions.**

**After you've finished the first part, sign up for the second part [here](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/7ww7nL5)**. Again, please complete all assignments in order.

**When you've finished with the second part, sign up for the third and final part [here](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/7wxall8)**.

## Finishing Up

Once we have verified that you passed the repl.it assignments 100%, we will verify your application and invite you to join the class.
