# Lambda iOS Challenge

If you have not yet filled out the form at https://lambdaschool.com/ios-challenge/ please do that before submitting your challenge.

In order to remove even more barriers for those that want to participate in Lambda School, we've created the Lambda Challenge. Based on our data, we are confident that if you can complete the Lambda Challenge, we can help you learn to code, and get a job as an iOS developer. This test enables you to bypass the regular precourse work. 

If the questions in here are too difficult then you can begin working through our regular precourse work which covers the fundamentals [here](https://apply.lambdaschool.com/courses/ios-precourse/).

You should also complete an application for our iOS course if you have not already done so. Apply [here](https://lambdaschool.com/courses/cs/ios/full-time/apply/).

## Prerequisites

In order to complete these challenges you will need a basic understanding of the following concepts:

```
Swift
  constants and variables
  types such as String, Int, Bool, etc.
  conditionals
  optionals
  loops
  functions
  collections
```

## The Challenge

The iOS challenge consists of three parts. Join the first part [here](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/7wv4ob2). If you have never used repl.it before, you will need to sign up for a free account.

You will then see a list of assignments. Please complete them in order (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, etc.). Repl.it works like an online Swift Playground. You are able to write and run code there directly. It will also test your code to make sure it works. The tests can be somewhat finnicky, so the instructions may tell you to do something like print a variable or function in order for the tests to test your code correctly. **Please be sure to read all of the instructions.**

**After you've finished the first part, sign up for the second part [here](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/7ww7nL5)**. Again, please complete all assignments in order.

**When you've finished with the second part, sign up for the third and final part [here](https://repl.it/classroom/invite/7wxall8)**.


## Finishing Up

When you've finished, send an email to [karen@lambdaschool.com]()

Once we have verified that you passed the repl.it assignments 100%, we will send you an email to schedule an interview.
